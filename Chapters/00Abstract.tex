Solar Energy is an emerging renewable energy source that has been gaining significant
attention in recent years. The increasing demand for sustainable energy
solutions has led to the exploration of various solar energy technologies, including
land-based and floating photovoltaic (PV) systems. However, with widespread adoption,
there is a need to evaluate the performance of these systems under different
environmental conditions to determine their efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and
environmental impact.

The main objective of this study is to develop deep learning models to detect
and classify defects in photovoltaic (PV) systems, specifically focusing on land-based
and floating PV systems. The research aims to address the challenges associated
with the performance of these systems, particularly in terms of their efficiency,
cost-effectiveness, and environmental impact. The study will utilize simulation
tools to model the performance of land-based and floating PV systems under
various environmental conditions, such as solar irradiance, temperature
variations, and the influence of water bodies on the efficiency of floating PV systems.
